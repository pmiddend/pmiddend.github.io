<h1>Multiple monitor configurations in Linux</h1>
<p>
Like many people today, I have more than one monitor attached to my
PC. In my case, I've got the following setup:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Laptop screen</li>
<li>Main screen for working (attached via HDMI)</li>
<li>TV (also HDMI)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Since the laptop only has one HDMI port, when I want to switch from
the main screen to the TV screen, I have to manually switch the cables.
I could get an HDMI switch for ~15 euros, but until now I didn't
bother. Probably because more annoying than switching in hardware was
switching the displays in software. Let me explain my use-cases:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For normal day-to-day work, I only use the main screen. The laptop
screen is turned off.</li>
<li>When I want to watch a show or movie, I have the TV and the laptop
screen on (the laptopf screen is on just so I can control the media
player directly, without turning my head to the TV while I'm
typing).</li>
<li>When I'm on the road, only the laptop screen is on (naturally).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Now, with desktop environments like GNOME/KDE, you have some
intelligence built-in which remembers this configuration. I don't know
how this is done, but when you plug the TV in, it remembers that when
this happens, I want to switch to it and turn on the laptop
screen. This is very handy, and I wanted just that, without having to
use GNOME/KDE in its entirety.
</p>

<p>
Turning screens on and off can be done with the <code>xrandr</code>
program. Running <code>xrandr</code> without arguments gives me:
</p>

<pre class="example">
âžœ  ~  xrandr
Screen 0: minimum 8 x 8, current 1920 x 1080, maximum 16384 x 16384
VGA-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
LVDS-0 connected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
   1920x1080     60.01 +  40.01  
DP-0 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
HDMI-0 connected primary 1920x1080+0+0 (normal left inverted right x axis y axis) 477mm x 268mm
   1920x1080     60.00*+
   1680x1050     59.95  
   1600x900      60.00  
   1280x1024     60.02  
   1280x800      59.81  
   1280x720      60.00  
   1024x768      60.00  
   800x600       60.32  
   640x480       59.94  
DP-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
</pre>

<p>
So you can see that LVDS (the laptop display) and HDMI-0 (the main
screen) are connected. All the other ports are disconnected. Below the
devices are their possible resolutions, followed by the refresh
rate. Next to that is an optional asterisk, telling me which of the
resolutions is currently selected. The laptop display LVDS-0 doesn't
have an asterisk next to its only supported resolution, which tells
you that it's turned off right now.
</p>

<p>
With the <code>--output</code> option you can configure a specific output
device. There are a lot of options available here, like brightness,
rotation and so on. We're only interested in turning the thing on and
off:
</p>

<pre class="example">
xrandr --output &lt;device&gt; --off
xrandr --output &lt;device&gt; --auto
</pre>

<p>
It's a little odd that there is no option <code>--on</code>, but whatever...
</p>

<p>
So we can turn things on and off and we can query what's currently
connected - very nice! We could write a shell script that calls
<code>xrandr</code> without arguments, checks which devices are available and
configures them.
</p>

<p>
Of course, we'd have to distinguish different devices on the same HDMI
port. The configuration for the TV is not the same as the main monitor
configuration, although both are connected on the HDMI port. A good
way to do that is using the device's "EDID", which is a code
containing the device's model name, manufacturer and so on. You can
query that with the <code>verbose</code> option of xrandr.
</p>

<p>
My instinct, though, was that I'm not the only one having this
problem, and that someone probably wrote this script for me. And I was
right, there is a project called <a href="https://github.com/phillipberndt/autorandr.git">autorandr</a> that does exactly what I
was talking about. Using it is a breeze. Plug in your devices,
configure them via <code>xrandr</code>, and then call <code>./autorandr.py --save
name</code> where <code>name</code> is a profile name of your choice.
</p>

<p>
I created three profiles, "movies", "mobile" and "work", corresponding
to the configurations I mentioned at the begining. Calling
<code>./autorandr.py</code> without arguments outputs
</p>

<pre class="example">
movies
mobile
work (detected) (current)
</pre>

<p>
The script detected my main screen and deactivated the laptop
screen. When I unplug my main screen and plug in the TV, I can call
<code>./autorandr.py --change</code> and it'll enable the laptop screen and the
TV. Very nice!
</p>

<p>
There is one problem left: <i>When</i> do I call this script? It would be
best if it's called when the configuration changes, so when a device
is plugged out or plugged in. The Linux subsystem responsible for
these kinds of events is udev, and you can see which udev events are
triggered when you do stuff by typing:
</p>

<pre class="example">
udevadm monitor --property
</pre>

<p>
You can try it out, just enter it (as root or as a normal user) and
open your optical drive (if you have one). Or plug in a USB
device. It'll tell you all sorts of stuff: Where the device is located
below <code>/dev/</code>, what medium was inserted, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The monitor remained silent, however, when I plugged in a device via
HDMI. It turns out that due to a missing feature in the NVidia driver,
these notifications do not work. Bummer. Maybe with your Intel/AMD GPU
this approach will succeed, but I gave up here.
</p>

<p>
So what did I do? I just added this code to my <code>~/.xsession</code> and felt
bad:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-sh">while true; do
  $HOME/autorandr/autorandr.py --change --skip-options=gamma
  sleep 10s
done
</pre>
</div>

<p>
It's bad, I know, but it works for now. <code>--change</code> is intelligent and
does nothing if the configuration did not change.
</p>

<p>
The <code>--skip-options</code> directive instructs autorandr to ignore the gamma
setting when checking for new or changed configurations. This is
needed for <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">redshift</a>, which I use to turn down the gamma when it's
getting dark outside.
